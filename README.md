# an-internet-of-beers

This app and service is based on the talk [An Internet of Beers given at ThatConference](https://www.thatconference.com/Sessions/Session/10592) on Tuesday, August 9, 2016. It integrates into [Untappd](http://untappd.com) and provides a way to estimate your blood alcohol content (BAC) based on the beer you check into. 

While this application has attempted to implement the [NHTSB's 1994 BAC algorithm](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Hustad/publication/7906019_Using_calculations_to_estimate_blood_alcohol_concentrations_for_naturally_occurring_drinking_episodes_A_validity_study/links/00463519b7747666ee000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail), it is intended only to demonstrate the concept and is not meant to provide an accurate measurement. Please do not make any decisions based on the output of this service.
